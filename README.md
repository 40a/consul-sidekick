# consul-sidekick

Automatic peer management for [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) in
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

consul-sidekick is designed to run as a sidecar container in each Consul pod. It
obtains the list of peer pods from the Kubernetes API Server and periodically
syncs the Consul pod accordingly.

Advantages:
* Uniform deployment. All instances of Consul are deployed identically. No need
  to worry about the `-bootstrap` flag.
* Consul instances are treated as [_cattle_](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/), avoiding the [limitations of StatefulSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#limitations).  
* No more stale peers when pods are replaced or deleted.
* No more bootstrapping issues. No need for an external bootstrapping service
 Â like [Atlas](https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/atlas.html) (now deprecated).

## Install

See an [example](/examples) of how to use it.

## Limitations

For now it assumes that the Consul pods are controlled by a
[ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/).
However, it should be easy to extend to other controllers if needed.
